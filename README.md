## Welcome! 👋
My name is Matt Martindale, I'm an iOS Developer living in the greater Salt Lake City area. I'm currently studying at Lambda Inc.  
I love to create, whether that be from my leatherwork 🐮 or making apps 📱.

Here are some awesome projects you should check out:

![HitTips Logo](https://github.com/matt-martindale/HitTips/blob/master/Images/HitTipsLogo.png) ***[HitTips](https://github.com/matt-martindale/HitTips)*** \- A sarcastic tipping calculator that critiques your tip.
- ***[Moody Me](https://github.com/matt-martindale/Mood-Tracker)*** \- A mood tracking app to log what your overall mood was for the day. With the ability to add a note and the handy graph to give you a quick glance as to what mood you feel most.
- ***[Atomic Age](https://github.com/matt-martindale/AtomicAge)*** \- A merge game where you fuse atomic materials together to create the next element. Designed in a 1950's style to reflect the artwork during the classic Atomic Age.
